// Note:
// Enum is nothing but a list of constants (constant variables).
// There is no need to give any semicolon in enum.

// What is a constant variable?
// Constant is a value that cannot be changed after assigning it.
// Java does not directly support the constants. 
// There is an alternative way to define the constants in Java by using static and final keyword.
// Ex: (In this way we declare a constant variable inside a class)
// public static final int a = 5;
// static keyword for easy access & memory management and final keyword so 
// that value cannot be changed.
